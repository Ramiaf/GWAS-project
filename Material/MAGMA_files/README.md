# This folder contains all the input and output files/folders of MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation)
  - GWAS_summary_stat.txt is file that summarizes the GWAS study conducted on sampled SNPs (will be used for gene association study).
  - Gene-SNP_mapping_input_files contains gene and SNP info which will be used for gene-SNP mapping.
  - Gene-SNP_mapping_output_files contains the annotations files of gene_SNP mapping.
  - MAGMA_PLINK_geno contains original geno files (<i>.bed</i> and <i>.fam</i> from Hail workshop and <i>.bim</i> is updated) and updated geno files using PLINK.
  - MAGMA_gene_analysis contains association levels (p-values) of genes to the trait of interest using annotation files.
  - GENE-SETs.txt contains biological pathways and their associated genes (will be used to perfrom gene-set association with a trait).
  - MAGMA_gene-set_analysis contains association levels (competitive and self-contained) of gene-sets (powerful to identify pathway associations with trait of interest).
