GO terms are organized in a hierarchical manner as a directed a-cyclic graph.
There are broad GO terms that encompass more specific GO terms;
For example, 'bio process' is a GO term but 'tRNA metabolic process' is more specific
--> propagate_counts=False means that it will not include the broader terms of the GO term being observed; more specificity.


enriched = overexpressed.
GO enrichment means finding the GO terms that are overexpressed within a certain set of genes
