# GWAS-project
This project serves as a building base for performing bioinformatics GWAS with enhanced features. The main purpose of this project is not to asnwer a biological research question, but to experiment on the combinations of different state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to enhance the traditional GWAS.<br>
The phenotypes are fake and the results of the GWAS are purely exploratory, so feel free to adjust the data and used parameters based on your needs.
